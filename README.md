# Client-Server_Communication_Setup-App
# Project: Client-Server Chat Application Simulation  This project aims to test all the concepts learned so far regarding mutual exclusion and locking via practical implementation. The task is to simulate a chat application using a client-server communication setup without the use of sockets, but with multi-threading.
